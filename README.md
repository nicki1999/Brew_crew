# Brew_Crew

A new Flutter project with firebase.

## Why firebase?
- Easy authentications
- Cloud hosting
- Offering real-time database called firestore

## Authentication Structure

## User data structure
- Firestore creates a UID for every user, I use that to link brews to users.
- Brews properties are name, sugars, strength
